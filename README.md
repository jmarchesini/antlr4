# antlr4

Selected exercises from Terrence Parr's [The Definitive Antlr 4 Reference](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/) and [Language Implementation Patterns](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns/)

* [hello](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns/): the very basics

* [ch4](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/ch4): antlr4 book examples covering XML, Java interfaces, simple expressions and a calculator

* [ch8](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/ch8): antlr4 book examples covering json-to-xml, a call graph viewer and basic symbol tables

* [lip-ch10](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/lip-ch10) A bytecode assembler, disassembler, a stack-based bytecode interpreter and a register-based bytecode interpreter.  These are the three patterns from *Language Interpretation Patterns* refactored to work with antlr4.
