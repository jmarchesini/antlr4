# antlr4

Selected exercises from Terrence Parr's [The Definitive Antlr 4 Reference](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpantlr2/the-definitive-antlr-4-reference/) and [Language Implementation Patterns](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns/)

* [hello](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpdsl/language-implementation-patterns/): the very basics

* [ch4](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/ch4): antlr4 book examples covering XML, Java interfaces, simple expressions and a calculator

* [ch8](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/ch8): antlr4 book examples covering json-to-xml, a call graph viewer and basic symbol tables

* [lip-ch10](https://github.com/jmarchesini/antlr4/tree/main/lip-ch10) A bytecode assembler, disassembler, a stack-based bytecode interpreter and a register-based bytecode interpreter.  These are the three patterns from *Language Interpretation Patterns* refactored to work with antlr4, and to clean up and remove the duplication in the sample code.  (Each pattern in Parr's sample code is complete on its own and thus duplicates a number of classes.)
